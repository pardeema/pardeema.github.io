        <p><em>EDITOR NOTE: This article is a direct parody of <a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2014/07/11/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers">Lebron's SI article</a>. To maximize enjoyment of the below article, you should definitely read Lebron's as well</em></p>
<p>Before anyone cared where I would buy a house, I was a kid from Salt Lake City. It’s where I ran. It’s where I boarded. It’s where I hurt knees. It holds a special place in my heart. People there have seen me grow up. I’m literally their daughter. Their sister. Their support is overwhelming, it’s gotten me where I am.</p>
<p>Remember when I was walking at high school graduation? I was thinking, this is it. I could feel it. I was leaving something, going on to college, starting an adventure that would then take me across the country and back again. If I had to do it all over again, I’d obviously do things differently; like never drive in Maryland. But I’d still have left. Oregon, for me, was college. It helped raise me into who I am. I became a partner and met a great man. I will always think of Eugene as my second home. Without the education and experiences I had there, I wouldn’t be able to do what I’m doing today.</p>
<p>I went to Maryland because of MP and C-plex. We lived with BD. I loved becoming a friend to Sturdi. We could create something magical when we came together. And that’s exactly what we did! The hardest thing to leave is what we built with those guys. I’ve talked to some of them and will talk to others. Nothing will ever change what we have. We are friends for life. And that goes for our friends in Denver as well.</p>
<p>I’m doing this essay because I want an opportunity to broadcast this message at once, to all friends and family. I don’t want anyone thinking: Oh, I wasn’t important enough to be told about this. …I wish we had known you’d be leaving. We want to update you all.</p>
<p>I’m not having a press conference or a party. After this, it’s time to get to work. I literally have my first day Monday.</p>
<p>When I left SLC, I was on a mission, but not that kind of mission. I was seeking degrees, and I got two. I got to live in different places, visit so many special locations, see a lot of the country. My goal is still to travel as much as possible, no question. But what’s important to me is having a place to return home to, a place where we have put down roots.</p>
<p>I always believed I’d return to Salt Lake and settle down there. I just didn’t know when. After graduation, I was just looking for a job and seeing if the relationship would work. I started thinking about what it would be like to raise my family in my hometown. I looked at other places, but wasn’t going to leave for anywhere except some place with mountains. The more time passed, the more it felt right. This is what makes Marc and I happy.</p>
<p>To make the move I needed the support of my husband. The resignation letter, the job search, delving into home ownership - it’s all been challenging. Coming home to friends and family, moving farther from friends and family. My emotions were more mixed. It was easy to say, “OK, I don’t want to deal with these drivers ever again”. But then you think of the friends and things to see and you know you’ll miss it.</p>
<p>I’m not promising a grandkid. I know how hard it is to deliver. We’re not ready right now. No way. Of course, I want to eventually, but I’m realistic. It will be a long process, much longer than I want. My patience will get tested. I know that. I’m going into a situation with a young team and new parents. Until then I think I can help Lindsay with her downtown rehearsals. And I think I can help cheer on the boys at their games and meets. And I can’t wait to reunite with my friends, some of my favorite people.</p>
<p>But this is not only about the friends or the family. I feel my calling here goes above coming back to a spot I know. I have a desire to come back to a spot where I’m enveloped by mountains. Where I can have a ski day. Where I can be more involved in my niece and nephews’ lives. I want to be the cool house. That would make me smile.</p>
<p>In Salt Lake things can get weird. Everyone knows each other. You work hard to buy strong alcohol.</p>
<p>I’m ready to accept the challenge. I’m coming home.</p>
